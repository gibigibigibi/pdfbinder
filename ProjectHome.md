PDFBinder is a simple tool that lets you merge any number of PDF documents into one, without having to resort to slow, user-unfriendly, expensive software.

With a good PDF printer, like [PDFCreator](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/), and PDFBinder installed on your workstation, you are able to do anything in PDF. Example: attach a "print" of a website and a scanned pile of vouchers to your meeting agenda, before you e-mail it as one single PDF document.

PDFBinder is written in C#, and uses [iTextSharp](http://itextsharp.sourceforge.net/) to do all the PDF magic.
